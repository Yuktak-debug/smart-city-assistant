#  SmartPath – A Smart City Assistant

**SmartPath** is a Python-based smart city assistant that helps users find the shortest and most efficient route between key locations within a city. Built using Dijkstra’s algorithm and enhanced with a graphical interface and custom visualizations, this project is a simple yet effective example of combining algorithmic logic with real-world applications.

##  Features

- 🔍 Find shortest path using Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- 🖼️ Graphical visualization of city locations with custom icons
- 📍 Interactive GUI for user input (source and destination)
- 📏 Displays total distance and optimal route
- 🏙️ Represents the city as a weighted graph

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Tkinter** – For building the graphical user interface
- **NetworkX** – For graph creation and management
- **Matplotlib** – For data visualization
- **Heapq** – For priority queue used in Dijkstra’s Algorithm

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- networkx
- pillow (optional, for icon handling in matplotlib)
- tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install matplotlib networkx pillow
